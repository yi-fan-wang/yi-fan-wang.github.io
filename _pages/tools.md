I list some programming codes relevant to my research.

### PyCBC

[PyCBC](https://pycbc.org) is a primary tool in my research, which can analyze gravitational wave data from compact binary coalescence.

- A distribution for chirpmass and mass ratio from uniform component mass. [Github PR](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc/pull/3681) 
- Adding testingGR parameters into pycbc_inference. [Github PR](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc/pull/3445)



### Machine Learning

- [A gitlab repository](https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/yifan.wang/summer-machinelearning) for summer intern student



### Gravitational Waveform Modeling

- PyCBC plugin for [SEOBNRE](https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/yifan.wang/eccentricity) developed by Prof Zhoujian Cao and his students.
