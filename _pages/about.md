Hi/Hallo/你好！

I'm a postdoc/junior scientist in the [Department of Observational Relativity and Cosmology](https://www.aei.mpg.de/obs-rel-cos) of [Max Planck Institute for Gravitationalphysics (Albert Einstein Institute)](https://www.aei.mpg.de).  I focus on the data analysis and interpretation of *gravitational wave* from compact binary coalescence, and implications for relativity and cosmology.

 Recently I am especially interested in: 

- Searching for primordial black hole dark matter signals in gravitational wave
- Testing general relativity with detected gravitational-wave events, and searching for exotic signals beyond general relativity
- Building waveform templates of gravitational wave from eccentric compact binary coalescence


### To desipher my name

My name consists of three Chinese characters (Wang and Yi and Fan). Moreover, Chinese family name comes first (for me, Wang), follwed by the given name (Yi Fan). Therefore, in China, people would call me Wang Yi Fan (王一帆), which literally means "one sail" and metaphorically means a voyage.
