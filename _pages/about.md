Hallo/Hi/你好！

I'm a junior scientist in the [Observational Relativity and Cosmology](https://www.aei.mpg.de/obs-rel-cos) department of [Max Planck Institute for Gravitationalphysics (Albert Einstein Institute)](https://www.aei.mpg.de). I'm mostly interested in investigating observational consequences of general relativity. Currently, my research focuses especially on data analysis and scientific implications of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence, such as testing the validity of general relativity in strong field and high energy region, looking for novel gravitational wave signals predicted by general relativity, etc.

My research projects are summarized in this page! (coming soon...)
