Hi/Hallo/你好！

I'm a postdoc/junior scientist in the [Department of Observational Relativity and Cosmology](https://www.aei.mpg.de/obs-rel-cos) of [Max Planck Institute for Gravitationalphysics (Albert Einstein Institute)](https://www.aei.mpg.de).  This is my academic website. My research interests include: data analysis and interpretation of *gravitational wave* from compact binary coalescence, and implications for relativity and cosmology.

 Recently I am especially interested in: 

- Searching for primordial black hole dark matter signals in gravitational wave
- Testing general relativity with detected gravitational-wave events, and searching for exotic signals beyond general relativity
- Building waveform templates of gravitational wave from eccentric compact binary coalescence
