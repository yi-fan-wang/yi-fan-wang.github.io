My current research interests are analyzing gravitational wave data from compact binary coalescence and exploring its implications. Some research topics of mine:

### Primordial Black Hole: 

- Search for high-mass-ratio sources. [Github repo](https://github.com/gwastro/stellar-pbh-search)
- Search for eccentric subsolar mass binareis. [Github repo](https://github.com/gwastro/subsolar-ecc-primordial-search)
- Event rate modeling for eccentric subsolar mass binaries. [Github repo](https://github.com/gwastro/prospects-subsolarmass-ecc)
- Primordial black hole EMRIs with space-based detectors. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07397)
- Stochastic gravitational-wave background from primordial black hole binaries. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08725)

### Testing General Relativity:

- Testing parity of gravity. [Github repo](https://github.com/yi-fan-wang/ParitywithGW) [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05668)
- Systematics using GW to test general relativity. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03306)



When I was undergradute student I used to study cosmology, inspired by the broad interested on primordial gravitaitonal waves and CMB (cosmic microwave background) in 2014.

- Constraining Neutrino mass with cosmology observation. [paper1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00672) [paper2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00588)
